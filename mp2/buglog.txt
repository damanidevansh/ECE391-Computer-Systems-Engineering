Description:
    The function draw_vert_line drew werid horizontal and vertical lines when
    moving across the screen. When the sprite moved towards the left, it drew
    gray vertical lines across the screen and when the sprite moved right, it
    drew gray horizontal lines across the screen.
Solution:
    My error was in my draw_vert_line function, where I had a few fixes to make.
    At first, I realized that my understanding of the draw_horiz_line function
    was wrong. The calculation for the starting address was something I failed
    to fully grasp at first. I accidentally switched the values of x and y when
    replicating the code for draw_vert_line, which I fixed after re-reading the
    code and discussing that line with a TA. I also had an issue with my for loop
    when copying the image data into appropriate planes in the buffer. There too,
    I failed to realize  the nested if statement only applied to draw_horiz_line
    so I got rid of it.

Description:
    About 50% of the times I pressed ` to exit out of the game, Devel would crash
    on me. The screen would go black and wouldn't let me ctrl+z or ctrl+c out of it.
    My only option was to X out of it and restart Devel.
Solution:
    I asked a CA and they first helped me check for memory errors that could cause
    issues. We could not find any. We then tried reverting the register values back
    to those from the initial Git release, after which we incrementally changed them
    while testing whether Devel would still crash or not. It did not crash again, and
    I am still unsure what was causing the original issue. My guess is I accidentally
    edited the wrong register which could have been causing memory issues.

Description:
    As soon as the sprite would reach the bottom of the screen, instead of it reaching the
    edge of the maze, it would go into the status bar and disappear until I moved it back up.
Solution:
    I realized that this may be caused because I forgot to change IMAGE_Y_DIM- the macro that 
    defines the height of the screen that shows the maze. When we added the status bar, we also
    changed the height of the screen that shows the maze by as many pixels as the size of the status
    bar, so 18 pixels. What was happening to my sprite was that the maze was still rendering beneath
    the status bar and was accessible to the sprite. I could not see it because those pixels were all
    rewritten to black. So, I redefined IMAGE_Y_DIM to be (200-18) in the modex.h file.

Description:
    When I was working on masking, there was an output where not only would the path of the sprite not
    be masked, there was a thick black diagonal line appearing across the screen which was drawn whenever
    I tried to move the sprite.
Solution:
    My error was a trivial one, as I made a typo when trying to call draw_full_block after my masking 
    function. In one of the instances, instead of a play_x and a play_y, I was passing in play_x and
    play_x agai instead of play_y. Fixing this one letter lead to not only the diagonal line disappearing
    but also caused the masking function to wholly work.

Description:
    When I was trying to add text to my status bar, I was able to successfully see my background color but
    my text was not outputting correctly. Instead of seeing letters and words, I was seeing blobs of weird
    rectangles in my status bar. The silver lining though was that those rectangles were the color I had coded
    in, so at least I knew that my coloring was correct
Solution:
    This too was a very trivial problem. When right shifting my mask in my text_to_graphics function, instead
    of mask = mask >> 1, I had written mask >>1 mask. Once I fixed that, the correct text was outputted.

Description:
    When I was initially trying to obtain the starting times of the function, I was crashing devel every time
    I would run the mazegame. It would freeze and was unable to even render the game, which caused me to X out
    of it every time.
Solution:
    I am still a little unsure what was actually causing my bug. Since it was not during someone's Office Hours,
    I was unable to ask for help but regardless, I ended up deleting all my time-related code and restarting, and
    this time, it worked. what I think could have been the issue, however, is the fact that I misunderstood the time
    data type. Instead of using a time_t data type, I was directly using integers which I think may have crashed the
    code, but I am not sure. When I changed all my variable types to time_t, the function worked fine.

Description:
    This is the fruit edge-case bug- where when a fruit is present on an edge which stops the sprite from moving
    (such as a corner or a wall when you come perpendicularly into it), the sprite is unable to pick up the fruit
    upon first contact, but only picks it up when it moves again. This did not occur too much, but it did happen
    enough times for it to be a noticable effect.
Solution:
    In mazegame.c's *rtc_thread function, getting rid of the need_redraw loop worked in fixing that. What I think
    was causing it was that while the loop helped with efficiency, it redrew the fruit onto the position of the
    sprite when it got onto it, which then seemed like the fruit was still under it- only finally getting erased
    when the sprite would move elsewhere.

Description:
    When I was trying to figure out how to change the wall's colours and when I was initializing my palette function,
    I was having an issue where my game's fog was changing colour instead of the walls or boundaries.
Solution:
    It turns out that my implementation of my palette function was a little messy. In order to work around this, I changed
    up my logic, where I copied the entire RGB palette over and manuall fed in inputs to change it. I also realized that I
    was PUTSing the wrong number of colours to output.

Description:
    When I was implementing my draw_transparent_block function, I had an issue when even though I had unit tested my masking
    and redrawing function, I was having an issue where the block was drawing a black streak all over the screen- similar to
    the issue we had to fix in MP2.1.
Solution:
    I did not realize I had to call my overall masking function first to save the old image in a buffer before calling my draw_transparent_block
    function. Once I did this, the function worked properly.

Description:
    WHenever I was running su -c ./mazegame, my entire system would freeze and deadlock where I was not able to do anythingafter
Solution:
    I realized that in my tux_thread function, I had a lock which I was never unlocking, which was causing the entire system to crash.
